## What is Jitsi
As [Jitsi](https://jitsi.github.io/handbook/docs/intro)'s website states:

!!!quote "What is Jitsi?"
    Jitsi is a collection of Open Source projects which provide state-of-the-art video conferencing capabilities that are secure, easy to use and easy to self-host.

In other words, Jitsi is a video conferencing suite - video server, client, video stream negotiator, media session manager, SIP gateway, and stream/recording manager.

## Getting started
Because of its agnostic nature, this guide recommends using the [Docker container guide](https://jitsi.github.io/handbook/docs/devops-guide/devops-guide-docker). However, as seen on that page there are other methods of installing: [Debian/Ubuntu](https://jitsi.github.io/handbook/docs/devops-guide/devops-guide-quickstart) and [Manual](https://jitsi.github.io/handbook/docs/devops-guide/devops-guide-manual). Use whichever deployment you're comfortable with for your environment.

!!!attention
    Always read the source docs, do not rely directly on this page. This is an overview, and should be treated as such
